# Locations

### Small app to work out with UITableViewController, MapView and Core Location

* App that queries a URL to fetch locations and display in a TableView
* Clicking on a cell shows a map with store location and user location
* If user doesn't authorize for user location, then it defaults to Chicago downtown.

### Testing

* View Controller unit test to check if request is being called correctly.
* Service request test to check if data is being parsed correctly
* Test to see if struct is being mutated correctly.
* UI Testing happy path.
